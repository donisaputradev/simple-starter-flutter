# 📱 Simple Starter Flutter

Simple Starter Flutter is a template starter project **Flutter** following a modular and scalable architecture.  
The project is structured around `core`, `features`, and `app` layers, making it easy to maintain, test, and extend.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔑 **Authentication** (login, register, session management)  
- 🏠 **Home dashboard** with modular widgets  
- ⚙️ **Settings** with preferences and localization  
- 🌐 **API integration** with network layer and error handling  
- 📦 **Dependency injection** using service locator pattern  
- 🌍 **Internationalization (i18n)** support with ARB & generated localization files  
- 🛠 **Clean Architecture**: separation of concerns between `core`, `features`, and `app`

## 🏗 Architecture Notes

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles:

- **Presentation layer (features)** → UI, state management, and user interactions  
- **Domain layer (core/usecase)** → Business logic in form of use cases  
- **Data layer (core/data, core/network, core/preference)** → Repository pattern with API & local storage  

This makes the app modular, testable, and maintainable.
